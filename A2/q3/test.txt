Nadia fondled the eggplant 
the handsome poodle brought Ross to the autoclave 
Nadia brought a cloth for the cheese 
they told her to jump onto the elephant 
she believed that Ross was already on the hovercraft 
she really wanted help 
she really aspired to help 
cheese was always on the menu 
the eggplant reminded Nadia of Ross 
Nadia found 
Ross brought to him 
they told to jump onto the elephant
Nadia rewarded the man with the eggplant
Nadia won an elephant
a rutabaga could have been demanded 
autopoiesis always reminded her of Marseilles
I saw Nadia on a boat with my elephant
Nadia was reminded
an elephant had been being won 
an elephant would have been being won
